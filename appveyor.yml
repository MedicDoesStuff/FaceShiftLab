#test_script:
#  # Put your test command here.
#  # If you don't need to build C extensions on 64-bit Python 3.3 or 3.4,
#  # you can remove "build.cmd" from the front of the command, as it's
#  # only needed to support those cases.
#  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
#  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
#  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.
#  - '%PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py test'

#after_test:
#  # This step builds your wheels.
#  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
#  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
#  # interpreter
#  - '%PYTHON%\python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel'

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
